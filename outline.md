## BlackJack Page

### What renders on page first:
* ~~Background image~~
* ~~Space for dealer’s hand and player’s hand~~
* ~~Display money amount~~

### After clicking play

* ~~If bust Results~~

### If player stays the dealer’s turn
* ~~Dealer hits until they bust or stay within rules (logic) (Stay on 17 or higher)~~
* ~~If Dealer busts then go to Results~~
